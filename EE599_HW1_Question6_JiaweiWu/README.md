//Factorial function
//this function will not work if the input number is larger than 13
//ince 13!=7227020800 and 14!=8.71782912*(10^10)
//14! is too big to show the accurate result in my Casio caculator. 
//In order to improve the efficiency of coding, I did not care about the number larger than 13.
